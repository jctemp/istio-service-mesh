You can see all the documentation at <https://jctemp.github.io/istio-service-mesh/> as a served static website or look at the files in `/docs`.
Alternatively, it is possible to clone and deploy the site locally yourself.
Just follow the instructions below.

To see the docs, install `mkdocs` with the pip package manager. Optionally, create a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, we can serve the page with `mkdocs serve` and see the local website.
