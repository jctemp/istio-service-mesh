# Environment

!!! info
    Using a virtual environment can cause unexpected behaviour.
    Even a setup on a native OS can still cause problems that are probably correlated to the preview version.
    Therefore, it is interesting to see how the upcoming release of the ambient mesh looks and if it provides better support.

We used a VPS with four cores and 8GB of RAM for the benchmark.
The installed OS is Ubuntu 22.04.1, as it offers the best compatibility.
Details of the VPS are listed below.
