Observationns:
- from 00:20 until 00:25 we had the stress test
- CPU usage normalised at 00:28
- MEM usage was already high (7.74 GB at peak)
- not all pods had a MEM consumption of 130MB
- interestingly, at 00:27 the services with less MEM consumption increased, 
  whilst the others slightly decreased about 3MB
- an increase of MEM consumption can be correlated to a preparation for another high load
- CPU Usage remained at minimum at all time after high load

Observations:
- from 00:48 until 00:53 was the stress test
- CPU usage normalised at 00:56
- MEM usage had a 3.77 GB peak
- during the stress test the CPU usage was not constant, further usage was higher than 10 replica count
  that might be an indicator for a performance hit
- as with the previous test, the MEM usage slightly rises to the end, but not as prominant
- during stress testing some proxies needed to increase their MEM usage
- the throughput (http_reqs) decreases as the proxies have more load to handle

Observations:
- from 01:17 until 01:22 was the stress test
- CPU usage normalised at 01:24
- during the stress test the CPU usage was better but still not constant
- this time some http_reqs_failed
- only the `poductpage` poxy was increasing MEM consumption, even more than previous
- after the stress test, as with the previous runs, the MEM consumption reduced slight but was
  nonetheless 15MB more than previous
